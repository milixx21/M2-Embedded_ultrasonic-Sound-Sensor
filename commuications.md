# Communication Protocols
## Wired
#### In this project we use UART communication protocol.
### UART  - TX & RX (2 devices)
* 2 Wire
* Individual clocks used by the both parties
* Standard speed (9600, 115200) - Baud rate
* Parity

## Factors to decide on which communication prototocol to select
### * Frequency :
We need 2oKHz frequency for this project because of this UART is suitable for this model.
### * Data throughput
### * Number of pins available :
There are two pins are avaiable.
#### [1] TX (Pin no 3)
#### [2] RX (Pin no 2).
TX and RX pins we need to display our result .

# * Error detection (UART ) capability
